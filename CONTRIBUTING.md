# Contributing to OpenWallet Foundation Helm Charts

- Create new charts in the `charts/` directory using a unique, meaningful name matching the OWF project the chart is referencing.
- Bump the chart version in `Chart.yaml` for any changes.
- All charts are linted and tested automatically on PRs.
- On merge to `main`, changed charts are published to GitHub Pages.
